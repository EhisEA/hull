                            Thanks! it's amazing. however, I cannot open this and 'cleverly' which was also just released by the same author, on sketch 63.1. I get a message that says that the file... On the other hand, independent oil companies focus on a specific segment of the industry and typically engage in only one type of operation, such as exploration or production. While they may have a sharper focus on their core business activity, independent oil companies may face challenges in unfavorable market conditions due to the lack of profit counterbalance between upstream and downstream operations.
                            Integrated oil companies are involved in multiple stages of oil production, both upstream (exploration and production) and downstream (refining, distribution, and marketing). Being integrated allows these companies to have complete control over the entire value chain, leading to improved efficiency and diversified revenue streams. The oil and gas industry is dominated by several major companies, often referred to as "Big Oil." These companies are typically large, multinational corporations with significant resources and global operations. Some of the largest oil companies include Saudi Aramco, ExxonMobil, BP, Royal Dutch Shell, and Chevron.
                            Saudi Aramco, the world's largest integrated oil and gas company, leads the industry in terms of revenue and is not traded in the United States 3. Other major oil companies, such as ExxonMobil, BP, Royal Dutch Shell, and Chevron, are integrated companies involved in various stages of the oil production process. Oil companies are responsible for exploring and extracting oil reserves, refining crude oil into various petroleum products, and distributing and marketing these products to consumers. They invest heavily in research and development to improve extraction techniques, develop new technologies, and explore alternative energy sources.
                            These companies also contribute significantly to national economies, generating substantial revenue and providing employment opportunities. However, the oil and gas industry is facing challenges due to the increasing focus on renewable and alternative energy sources, pro-eco legislation, and governmental pressure.
