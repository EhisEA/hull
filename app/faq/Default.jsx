          She set up some Google Alerts, and subscribed to emails from assorted
          websites, but it was messy. And if members of the team weren’t already
          experts in an area (like bioprocessing, for example), Sienna found it

          For certain queries, Sienna and her team get their information from
          published literature in research journals, like PubMed. However, Sienna
          remembers how tricky things got when her team started getting requests
          for information about broader topics like drug innovations, regulatory
          decisions, political decisions, or industry updates. “Rather than being

          drug pricing, or the gene and cell therapy industry.” Sienna commented

          general areas where there is news, rather than just published
          literature.”
