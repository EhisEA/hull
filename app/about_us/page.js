					Doctors and researchers might ask Sienna’s team whether a particular
					drug was ever linked to an adverse event, like “Has amoxycillin ever
					caused encephalitis?” Or they might answer questions about new drug
					delivery platforms, like “How do you get our large molecule drug
					inside the cell so that it can actually get to the target, where it
					will do the work of curing the disease?” For questions like these,
					Sienna and her team seek information to compile resource lists or
					reports. <br /> <br />
					For certain queries, Sienna and her team get their information from
					published literature in research journals, like PubMed. However,
					Sienna remembers how tricky things got when her team started getting
					requests for information about broader topics like drug innovations,
					regulatory decisions, political decisions, or industry updates.
					“Rather than being about a specific disease, we started getting asked
					about things like drug pricing, or the gene and cell therapy
					industry.” Sienna commented that it wasn’t easy to capture this type
					of news about “those more general areas where there is news, rather
					than just published literature.”
